Lectric: Alexander Randall. Final character to gain powers from the Crash. Side effects of his powers increased his greed but no one knows he's a bad guy until he nearly takes down the Justice Alliance. He's aligned with Dangerous and Sarah after a certain point but he poses as a member of Therapy and tries to black widow (marry then murder to steal from) Rock Woman.
