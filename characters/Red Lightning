Red Lightning is a mechanically enhanced speedster from the year 2170. He can run faster than the speed of light and fell back here when he first did. At 23, he's working with his great great great grandfather and his younger great great grandmother building suits that let him harness his powers safely, and protecting Detroit from harm.
