### World Bible for a Universe called Therapy: 
a superhero universe where characters exist and are realistically traumatized thus need to go through therapy.

The Justice Alliance is a group made up of Duckman, Mosquito Man, Rock Woman, Red Lightning, and Arrowhead. Their powers didn't come from the Crash and they existed before the crash. They go to therapy as well, but they aren't members of the superhero team, Therapy.

The Crash was a literal car crash where two cars rammed into a tanker truck carrying Quantum Spin Liquid. One person, Abigail Rodriguez, died in the Crash. The rest gained powers.

The few who became heroic after the crash eventually joined together in a group called Therapy. This group consists of Majo, Privacy, Xscape and Silenced Wren. Temporarily they're joined by Lectric before he betrays them. Twilight, Dangerous, and a few others also gained powers from the crash. Lectric, twilight, and Dangerous are all villains. Only time can tell which side the others fall under.

The Therapy team also talks about the trauma from their super heroics in individual therapy sessions and talk about their group superheroics in group therapy sessions. A potential framing device for the comics is they're all sitting in the circle talking about what happened in their last missions.
